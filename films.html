							<p><span class="image left"><a href="https://youtu.be/q_ABL9FP2ps"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q_ABL9FP2ps/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLCBIU9WAqskBdRNQXl2QOpD_qu2zw" alt="" /></a></span>My classmate Jimena Castillo and I submited this project to SkillsUSA for the TV Production competition. I worked as the assitant director and key grip for this project. We drove to Texas A&M University for a college tour event called Aggieland Saturday. We filmed for about 4 hours and then drove back to our school where we recorded the voice over and edited the video in about 4 hours. This project showed us the work and effort that goes into a on-site shoot with a short deadline.</p>

I worked alongside two of my other classmates: Sarah Hilal, the lead writer and director, and Liam Abney, the assistant writer and director of photography. This project took us about three weeks to complete. It required a lot of offsite shooting at a local park and lots of team coordination and management. Some of the challenges we faced were scheduling shooting days when all our actors were available, and getting enough filming done before sunset. I gained some valuable experience from this project such as asetting up equipment on rough terrain, working on a larger scale project with multiple working parts, color grading in Adobe Premire Pro, and color keying in Adobe After Effects. This film was shot on the BlackMagic Ursa. This project was by far one of the most fun learning experiences in my high school career.</p>

							<p><span class="image left"><a href="https://youtu.be/X8vwoX5H1Kc"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gYivGWOMqSM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLAuHKsW985_6QXk2fvAmf5uYqLv3A" alt="" /></a></span>Written and directed by my classmate Brian Schonenman, Initial AVP is a parody of the hit anime Initial D. This is by far one of the most ambitious projects I have ever had the privilage of taking part in. I worked as a grip and gaffer on this film, staying after school almost daily for multiple hours. The whole project took a few weeks to complete and it definetly payed off. I gained lots of experience as a gaffer and grip from this project. A lot of the work done on set was finding unique solutions to complicated problems in order to get the perfect shot. Alot of the times very intricate riggin was reqired to pull off the kind of stylistic shots Brian wanted. One of the most memorable rigs was tying a rolly chair with a car mirror attached to it using gobo arms to a doorway dolly where the camera operator was and pointing a ligth at the mirror. Overall this project taught me what it was like to work late hours as only a grip and gaffer on a set. It also taught me how to manipulate lights to transform a regular location into a completely different environment.</p>

							<p><span class="image left"><a href="https://youtu.be/tH7g6KkGkYU"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tH7g6KkGkYU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLD0C38urv9vGXyznbVV1d1vqsxdxA" alt="" /></a></span>Ghost Cop is by far the biggest and most ambitious project I have ever taken part in. The crew consisted of the entirety of the class which totaled to about 20 people. The project took about two months to continue, I worked as a grip and gaffer on the project as well as helping edit the project. I gained lots of experienced working with a large crew by working on this project. I learned what it was like to work on a large project that spanned multiple weeks.</p>
